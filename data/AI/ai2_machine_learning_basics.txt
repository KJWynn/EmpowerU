Overview:
Machine learning is a core subset of AI that involves training models to recognize patterns in data. This module will explore different machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and introduce key algorithms.

What is Machine Learning? Machine learning (ML) refers to the ability of computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML models are trained on datasets and can improve their performance on specific tasks over time through experience.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data. Examples include classification and regression tasks. For instance, a spam detection system is trained on labeled emails (spam or not spam).
Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data by identifying patterns or clusters. Examples include clustering algorithms used for customer segmentation in marketing.
Reinforcement Learning: In this approach, an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments (e.g., a robot learning to navigate a maze).
Popular Machine Learning Algorithms

Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Decision Trees: A model that makes decisions based on a tree-like structure, where each node represents a feature and each branch represents a decision rule.
Neural Networks: A set of algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain, used for tasks like image and speech recognition.
Model Evaluation After training a model, it must be evaluated for its performance. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Cross-validation is a common technique for ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.
