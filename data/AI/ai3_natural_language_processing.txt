Overview:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an AI subfield focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This module will cover key NLP tasks, techniques, and real-world applications.

Content:
Introduction to NLP NLP enables machines to process and analyze large amounts of human language data. The ultimate goal is to allow computers to understand text and spoken language as naturally as humans do. NLP plays a critical role in voice assistants, chatbots, and language translation services.

Key NLP Tasks

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or phrases, called tokens, which are the building blocks for NLP tasks.
Part-of-Speech Tagging: Assigning parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives) to each token in a sentence.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying proper names (such as people, places, and organizations) in a text.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This is widely used in analyzing social media, reviews, and customer feedback.
Deep Learning for NLP

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): A type of neural network designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or text.
Transformers: An advanced neural network architecture that has become the foundation for state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and GPT. Transformers enable better understanding of context and relationships in long sequences of text.
Applications of NLP

Machine Translation: Automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).
Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Systems like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant rely on NLP to understand voice commands and respond accordingly.
Text Summarization: Automatically summarizing long documents into shorter versions, useful in fields like journalism, legal services, and education.
Challenges in NLP NLP faces challenges such as ambiguity in language, sarcasm detection, and contextual understanding. Moreover, models must handle the complexity of human languages across different dialects and cultures.
